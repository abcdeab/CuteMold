# cute_mold
Mold grow and evolution simulation. The mold gets energy for the void space around it, so the mold that has more void will survive.

Molds with the same genome have the same color, but different shades. Mold with a mutated genome get a new color. Cells with black dots are spores. 

Press G to generate new molds. Press Q/W to lessen/expand the amount of energy. Press P to pause.

Left-click on the mold to copy genome to clipboard. Click on the void space to create a new mold with the genome saved to your clipboard.
